mGLC version 0.3
Copyright (C) 2000 Paul Brannan

The mGLC library is an attempt to re-implement SGI's GLC library on a
platform other than Irix.  The GLC library is the GL character renderer,
"a state machine that provides OpenGL programs with character rendering
services via an application programming interface (API)."  It has several
advantages over platform-specific interfaces such as GLX or WGL.  For more
information, please see the GLC specification at
http://toolbox.sgi.com/TasteOfDT/documents/OpenGL/glc/glcspec.html.

This library is released under the GNU LGPL.  For more information, please
see the file LICENSE, or visit the GNU web page at www.gnu.org.

The following options are not supported (section numbers are for the above
document):
Master Commands (3.6.*, 3.7.14)
glcStringType (3.5.15)
Callbacks (3.5.1, 3.5.6)
Lists (3.5.7, 3.5.8)
Font Maps (3.7.5, 3.7.9)
Rendering Styles (3.9, 3.9.4)
Measurement Commands (3.10.*)
Replacement Code (3.9.5)
Resolution (3.9.6)

In other words:
- We use the font from the first encoding that we find (no font maps)
- Textured fonts are not (yet) supported.
- Rotated and scaled fonts are now supported.
